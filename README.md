# WHO'S THAT POKEMON? A fan-made commandline game

## Purpose
On my end? Developing as a developer by toying with readline, cl, and npm.

On your end? Fun! (And frustration... how often will you actually win a game with this type of implementation?)

## To install
Run `npm install pokegame -g`

## To play
Run `pokegame`
